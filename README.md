# Map Tuple

Provides traits to allow `map()`ing specific elements of a tuple. See
[docs](https://crates.io/crates/map_tuple) for details.

This differs from the [tuple-map](https://crates.io/crates/tuple_map) crate in
that the elements of the tuple don't have to be of the
same type, and can be mapped to unique different types.
